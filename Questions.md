<b>Q:</b> Difference between ( for... in ) and ( for... of ) statements?
A:"for in" loops over enumerable property names of an object.
"for of" (new in ES6) does use an object-specific iterator and loops over the values generated by that.
In case of array, the array iterator does yield all the values in the array (ignoring non-index properties).
